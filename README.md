To use this program, you will need to have the PygreSQL “pg” module installed. This can be accomplished with the command *pip install pygresql*.
You will also need a python IDE of your choice to edit the code.

The first step will be to build a database in PygreSQL to use in the code. You can do this manually or by uploading a .csv file. 
 
Then, you will want to open the main python file, CMPSC431_Project2, and edit the database name, username, host, and password to match your local system.

Then open your command prompt, run the .py, and now the program has started.
